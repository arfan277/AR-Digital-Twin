# AR Digital Twin Application


## Introduction

There is a fundamental gap between the vast amount of digital data we have access to and the actual environment in which we use it. Even though reality is three-dimensional, the abundant data we currently have to guide our actions and decisions is still contained on two-dimensional screens and pages. With the use of augmented reality and robotics, we created an android app that allows users to control a deployed AR robot arm (LBR iiwa 7 R800) through our platform. With our prior experience in AR and robotics, we found this project best suited for us. Allowing users to control the arm using forward kinematics and inverse kinematics, meant that our platform is fully utilized to be widely used in the respective sector. 

To test the app, please download the [APK file](TestApp).
